For anyone who wants a proper function of our system is recommended to work under the Google Chrome web browser,
Mozilla Firefox version 2.0 minimum, Opera or Safari and javascript enabled anyway.

Install the system and the database on a web server through which you will have access to the same system and 
the database from anywhere on the network even from anywhere in the world, otherwise the minimum requisition is
installed in a computer system staff to always be on during working hours and which will access through the 
local network, the machinery must meet the following minimum hardware and software:

Software

	Apache 2.0
	Google Chrome
	JavaScript enabled
	
Hardware
	Pentium 4 2.0 G:
	512 MB RAM
	5 G in DD
	Network card 10/100 MB

About Internet explorer
The Microsoft Internet Explorer is a web browser designed without adequate standards and time away from the 
quality standards in web design and unintuitive, projects designed on this basis, they usually have enough 
complications in Internet Explorer versions 7 down, then, built with the highest standards CSS, which is why we 
are recommended browsers developed under the architecture mainly netscape.


The organization of folders
Normally in a web system had no control over the files, ie classification and location with respect to the above, this project
and in all that are developed from this school, or culture, the files are sorted and placed as appropriate, for example:
There is a folder to store the style sheets and their needs, ie images that will be used only in styles, the project
There is also a folder to hold all the js scripts or libraries, scripts and his name is different contains folders that store
different libraries according to their origin.
There is also a folder named models, which contains classes as the builder of the tables in the database which will be modified
at any time since the php code and therefore requires its kind for proper operation.

There is a folder called classes that stores the different classes to build the necessary forms throughout the school system or this
required.
One more for the functions folder, connection and query functions, among others.
There is a folder for documentation, and everything needed to make the project work, both locally and on the internet
There is a folder to store and sort the images in subfolders to be stored in the system and are not specific to the styles of this
In addition there is a folder called vendors, which contains necessary to run the ajax and is updated, in addition to storing
  Script libraries outside the native development
There is also a folder called efrescos in scripts which are stored most common routines, such as: the login and logout
users and common operations on databases such as; Save and Edit
A license folder to place all licenses in case of using libraries or applications that need them.
It has a middle name folder is used to store files in folders for audio, video, documents, etc..
It has the Templates folder where templates are stored to keep the content of each page and each is accessed by
variable '$ page'.
It has a folder called languages ​​that stores language translation dictionaries specific to plain text files
And finally generate the necessary folders to the needs of each system.

The working and shift
The way in which this project serves to achieve better performance, and if not, at least for good and intuitive organization
file is:
It works with templates, files (. Tpl.php) in which only appears right through the HTML tags and php code, and presentation of
previous query results into objects of type array variables and calls to the functions required javascript or ajax, (in very
ends creates a javascript function within this file. tpl.php), contained in the folder Templars. Placed on the Index consultations
the database through a switch depends on the page you want to view and variables are constructed for presenting the results.

Variables
Variables that are used in the system are few and take many values ​​depending on the need.
Have been classified to achieve an intuitive logic, as follows:

- $ Login_id: This is one of the most important because it store the user currently logged into the system currently.

- $ Who_id: Refers to the id of a table that we want to touch and will link to the other with this as the main, and that having
a database may be located hundreds of tables so as few and as we do not know with certainty always
to begin designing the database are linked with a who_id for such reference.

- $ User_id: Sometimes you need the $ who_id to refer to other objects and so it requires an identifier
user, in such cases the two ends are used, the $ who_id for another object x, and the $ user_id user who
you want to refer

- $ Type_x: All data can be any type of data or different data, but they rarely use more than two in one
task, so this variable is used to assign different tasks xa data. for example the name of a field to be edited, and,
 for many other things and many other cases in which it is sometimes difficult to invent a concise name to refer to a variable.

- $ Task: The latter stores do what you want to do from a decision, for example, referring to a
user, what you want to do?, delete, edit, register it, among others.

- $ Validate This variable is used to send and receive a form to do if you already know this validated information is saved, otherwise
overlooked and is redirected if necessary or go to the next procedure.

- $ Field This variable refers to the field in a table that is to be changed by aja

- $ Path This variable refers to the path of a file to be deleted or the path to where you want to go after
perform some process.

- $ Row This is a unique variable should be used only to refer to the models needed to edit a table.

- $ List This is an array to store anything in the necessary and directly accessible by cycle or by position.

- $ Count: In normal cycles using a $ i $ j in conventional programming, this is simply a concise reference
you are using a counter for some task, in addition to the conventional variables $ i, $ j, $ k, $ l, $ m.

- $ Count_x: In very specific cases requires two counters or accumulators, so that the latter refers to a secondary counter.

- $ Version This variable is to keep the system version on which you are working.

- $ Page is implemented as of version 3.0, is the page you want to view.

- $ Window As of version 3.0 are implemented popups therefore this variable is used to find out which type of window
will open the new request, although it is not widely used variable.

- $ Where From version 3.1 are implemented search variables, therefore this variable is used to determine where to place the results
search request.

- $ Class_x From version 3.1 are implemented results listings, thus this variable is used in addition to the variables:
"$ Type_x" and "$ task".

Thus these variables are used throughout the system for different cases or situations data, of course, there are others that
do not mess with the name but is referred accurate or precise what is required, but usually these 17 are the most commonly used.
In addition to the variables used numbers should not be but the name of the variable and if needed another with the same name then the same "_x"

Variables of type Arrays
Normally you do not need many variables of type array, because there are already arrays intended query and data most
obtained from the database, thus fulfilling one of our programming rules "Do not repeat yourself", and if for example, you require a data list
extract and store is preferred for its ease of modification in a database in an array in the case of very large or if it will require more
than once, otherwise or for example in ajax file using arrays in two different varibles $ list to refer to a list
$ list_x important for the list of minor or second term if required in the same function and was used as the first variable.

Arrays
Arrays are the heart of this system, so it is necessary to have total control over them, it is the best way in which data is collected and stored.

Ajax
Ajax is the technology we use to make changes to the database and return without reloading or without reloading the entire page, just as
Importantly, these functions are executed in a file called ajax.server.php located inside the folder includes, how to use it is simple;
establishing a connection to the database, the query is made, is made routine and returns the result to where the request was made, and
new values ​​through a objResponse and the function declaration at the end of the document.

Active
The active are enum type fields with values ​​'1 'and '0' to indicate which is the state of an object in a database, 1 for active and 0 for inactive
these values ​​are changed to EditField function which will send the following parameters:
EditField ($ DbConecction, $ table, $ who_id, $ field, $ value)
- $ Table: the table is amended
- $ Who_id: What is the id that change state
- $ Field: Which field is modified
- $ Value The value to be stored in that register.

The connection to the database
To connect to the database must first verify that the database exists, if not exist within the folder
documentation is on file. zipped sql where is the script to create the database, with all or at least
Tables that are essential for a project start.
Once verified the previous step is passed to check the connection parameters, which are on file main.in.php included within the
includes folder, the connection parameters are:
$ Localhost = 'localhost', this is the server, usually this parameter should not be changed
$ User_root = 'root', this is the user's pointer on the working database
$ Local_pass = 'root', this is the password (password) for the above user
$ Name_root = 'base', and finally the database to which you will connect the project

Draw
The tables are called the common name in the singular, ie if a table is required to store the table called cars Cart

Fields
The first field in a table is called the table name + _id, to follow the example of the above table the first field would carro_id, index type, integer
of length 10, auto-incrementing, with key action.
When variables are records in a table that is, delete records needed as in the case of users or messages, helps active field takes
which is the last field in the table, enum type with values ​​'1 ', '0' by default 0
Fields should be organized in the table under the parameter of importance or following hierarchy:
numerical
char or text
date
enum

The field who_id
Who_id field in a table is an identifier to link tables, as it is not a particular characteristic of any table is fairly intuitive and comfortable when
work tables linked through this field, eg login table exists, image and the address table as follows:
| ============== | | ============== | | ============= |
| 				 | | 				| | 			  |
| Login_id 		 | | address_id 	| | image_id 	  |
| Nick 			 | | who_id 		| | who_id 		  |
| Pass 			 | | Street 		| | image		  |
| 				 | | 				| | Image_type    |
| ============== | | =============  | | ============= |

$ Sql ​​= "SELECT * FROM login, address, image
WHERE address.who_id = login.login_id
AND image.who_id = login.login_id
AND image.image_type = 'who' ";

reaches as seen in the example tables are joined based on the field who and images are classified into types of images giving a who for
people, so you could link any table without making a specific reference to a field in another table content, which in turn eliminates various error factors.

Consultations
Appreciate Similarly as in the previous example query is easy to distinguish between the SQL Query statements and characteristic of the alien elements which in this case
are the table names in lowercase.
Throughout the project, this structure must be maintained simply by the desire to always be organized and make it easier to display errors
or even view the result from this code may throw a sentence.

Updates regarding the latest version of previous

Version 3.0
- Integrates the AJAX v 2.1, changing the allocation methods in ajax.server.php
- Removed php design rule: "For each table in the database model is needed in PHP (model builders are single)" and create a single
flexible model to create the global variable "$ table" which stores the name of the table to modify.
- Build flexible storage algorithm routines in the folder with the name guardar.php
function is implemented from this version, easy editing and saving new records in any table, indicating the directions from the
file where the form is implemented, and meeting lists and variables needed to avoid generating more specific code to store
or edit various fields in any table, following the rules of specification:
- $ List - the list is way Array of Arrays of tables and fields that will be affected
- $ Lista_serialize - is this same above list serialized to post the data by the method "post"
- The fields should be called the same name as the fields are database where data is stored
- Tables should be called singular
- The first field is the name of the tabla_id
- Pasword type fields will be validated and encrypted in md5
- The fields of type secret, secret function call which dynamically generates the secret
- The fields of type file are logically selected as the file extension and which is stored in an array prior
- Flexible script is generated to validate fields on a form; rules:
- Requires the list of fields to validate the type of validation of each field,
(Currently only exist validation types: empty, mail, number and confirm)
- Variables are duplicated in the main connection, for comment is not used as work; locally or on the Internet.
- Inclination for the tables with collation utf8_unicode_ci mysam type

Version 3.1
- Removed the folders to store different files. Php and within each folder a subfolder of templates, now all templates
are stored in the folder of templates and access them from the index.php via a switch with variable page
- Added the media folder that are stored in different files classified by type.
- Scripts are stored in folders stored third in the main folder of scripts
- They integrate jquery libraries and other outsiders are removed causing conflicts
- Added the top right corner with the link to mozilla firefox browser to promote more friendly and multi-platform
- Integrates permission to print in the main permission Array, converting binary groups quartets to quintets
- Popups are implemented for quick records storage.
- Integrates the contact table in the database, which stores various phones, emails or a user's url, by removing these system fields
previous static in that only stored a phone, email and url of each user.
- Implemented the class to run php mailer sending mail to servers with complicated standards like hotmail
- Nick is eliminated as a method for validating the login and create the algorithm for loqueares by email us with the clause:
contacto.contacto_key = 1 in the contact table
- It creates and implements checarCorreo function, which validates the email to be the type az ,0-9, (-_.) @ Az.az
- The Delete permission in the permissions table is changed to Active name, which refers to the same permission by another name,
more appropriate to its function, since it really is affecting the field in a database
- The query is generated modules permits and are created from this, dynamic variables created from the query, leaving behind having
that generate this call manually to get the permissions of each module and its variables
- It creates the variable "$ class_x"
- Variables are generated "$ end, $ delta and $ start" which have no place from queries for paginating results
$ Start: where the consultation begins
$ Delta: the range that the query will
$ End: where consultation, which is the sum of $ start + $ delta

Version 3.2
- Added support for multiple connections to databases
- Was removed from the context of programming language in Spanish and translated into English as much as possible
- All variables are now called in its English translation
- The names of tables and database fields were changed into English
- Removed the folder "routines" and those files are moved to the folder "scripts"
- Integrates class translator which translates the visual context of English to Spanish
- It creates a folder that stores languages ​​translation dictionaries
